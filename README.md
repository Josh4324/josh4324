# Hi, I'm Josh!

I am an independent security researcher, focused on smart contract and blockchain security. 

I actively compete in top-tier audit contests and engage in private audits.

If you're looking to safeguard your smart contracts or need a reliable auditor for your next launch, Iâ€™m available for private audits.

## Professional background

I am a security researcher with a proven track record,  i have found over 100 critical, high, medium and low severity security vulnerabilities in total. I actively contribute to public audit competitions and have successfully completed 7+ private audits for defi protocols, helping secure projects with millions of dollars in assets.

Before blockchain security, I help built real word assets on the blockchain, we tokenized real estate properties, this was done using solidity and was deployed on evm compatible blockchains.

Prior to blockchain, I built web applications across the banking, entertainment, and education sectors, working on both frontend and backend systems. My main tools included React.js and Node.js, where I solved complex engineering problems and delivered scalable solutions.
